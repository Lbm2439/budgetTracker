## Description
Have you ever been backbacking through New Zealand on a tight budget and infrequent access to internet leaving you in the dark about how much money you have in your account?

I suppose you could keep a notebook, a calculator and a pen with you at all times to keep track of your current balance, but that sounds terrible.

With this app, you're able to enter each debit or credit to your account regardless of your internet connection and your present balance will be reflected. Once you reconnect to the internet, all of your cached entries will be sent to the database.

What could be better?
